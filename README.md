# glitch-code-css
Extremely cool CSS effect for that cyberpunk feel, expect more of this sort of thing soon when I convert everything over to that sweet cyberpunk vibe.

Got this idea from a Hyperplexed video, loved the effect wanted to take it further. Used keyframes and text shadow to create a vicious glitch effect while the letters went from random to their set value.

If you want to use for whatever you're working on, it's a very small file. Just change the origins of your dom elements in the JS file.

You can mess around with the colors, timing and 'code letters' if you want very easily.
